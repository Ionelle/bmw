## BMW Sales Analysis (2020–2024)

This repository contains a small analytics pipeline for BMW sales data from 2020–2024.  
It loads a local Excel file, performs basic and advanced sales analysis, generates charts, and (optionally) calls an OpenAI model to write an executive-style Markdown report.

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Python**: 3.8+  
- **Dependencies**: install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- **Data file**: the Excel file `BMW sales data (2020-2024).xlsx` must be in the project root (already included in this case).

### 2. Optional OpenAI configuration

If you want the AI-generated business report (`bmw_sales_ai_report.md`), you must:

- Install the OpenAI Python package (already covered if you use the provided environment; otherwise):

```bash
pip install openai
```

- Set your API key in the environment:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Without a valid key, the pipeline still runs the data analysis and chart generation but skips the AI report step.

### 3. How to run

From the project root directory:

- **Full analysis workflow (recommended)**:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:

- Load and clean the Excel data (`data_loader.py`)
- Run basic, trend, mix, and revenue analyses and print key tables to the console (`analyzer.py`)
- Generate all charts as PNG files in the project root (`visualizer.py`, files named `chart_*.png`)
- Optionally call the OpenAI API to generate `bmw_sales_ai_report.md` (`llm_client.py`)
- Write runtime logs to `bmw_analysis.log`

- **Compatibility entry point (optional)** – equivalent to running `main.py`:

```bash
python get_report.py
```

### 4. Main outputs

- **Log file**: `bmw_analysis.log` – detailed processing logs.  
- **Charts**: `chart_01_*.png`, `chart_02_*.png`, … – visualizations of trends, mix, and pricing.  
- **AI report** (optional): `bmw_sales_ai_report.md` – Markdown report generated by the OpenAI model.  
- **Executive summary documents** (if present): `executive summary.md` / `executive summary.pdf` – high-level findings for business stakeholders.
